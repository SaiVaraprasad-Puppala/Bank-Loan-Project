# Bank-Loan-Project

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, the Bank Loan Report project aims to address several key challenges and informational needs. The primary objective is to create a comprehensive set of dashboards that provide insights into the bank's loan portfolio, lending operations, and the quality of loans issued. 

The first dashboard, 'Summary,' focuses on essential loan-related KPIs, including total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. Additionally, it introduces the concept of distinguishing between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria, providing KPIs for each category. 

The second dashboard, 'Overview,' visualizes critical loan metrics and trends through various chart types, offering a clear and insightful view of lending operations. Chart types include line charts for monthly trends, filled maps for regional analysis, donut charts for loan term analysis, bar charts for employee length analysis, and purpose breakdowns, and a tree map for home ownership analysis. 

The third dashboard, 'Details,' serves as a consolidated interface for accessing comprehensive information about the bank's loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance. These dashboards collectively empower decision-makers with the necessary tools to make informed, data-driven decisions, track loan metrics, and assess the health and performance of the bank's loan portfolio.
